# How much is my Bitcoin worth？

I spent a few hours looking for a website which immediately gave me a conversion to BRL of how many BTC I had. I needed something quick and simple which kept the last amount I entered.

All the big apps are too much of a overkill, so I made this quick little app.

It’s supposed to be just for me, so I just converts to BRL. If you guys feel you could use it, I might make it convert in other currencies. Just drop me a line.
